The New Castle V26 - Released Nov 6/2022

The LINUX version of the new castle is the same code as the DOS/Windows version

HINT command has been re-added, but it's all covered in the docs, user guide, intro and instructions, so not necessary.

SAVE and RESTORE functions have been added - single slot SAVE availale
RESTORE is ONLY available at the start of a new game - it will prompt you
SAVE is limited and restricted in certain places, events, etc, and has a minimum move count. eg: The game will not save if you are in the maze

*** SAVE FILES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THIS VERSION AND FUTURE VERSIONS ***

simply unzip to any place you like, it will create its own directory. and read the castle_user_guide files (DOC or PDF) for information
for the linux version - decompressing the file downloaded with create a directory like ~/newcastle, then simply cd ~/newcastle
then run the Linux version of the game supplied: newcast (eg: ./newcast) to run it
For Linux users there are several choices on which image to download - there is a .tar.gz which works as usual,
and there is a .zip version which will uncompress making the directory needed as above
there is also a .tar.xz for those who prefer a smaller archive, xz is fantastic - the absolute best compression around. works same as the .tar.gz
The Linux version needs read/write access to its own files as save games and such create new files or update as you'd expect they'd need to...

The MAC Version has been ressurected! Finally I've been able to build the Mac binary. Unpacking and playing the Mac version is identical to the Linux version above
Except the Mac binary is called: newcastle_mac
it'll decompress creating a newcastle directory and putting eveyrthing you need in there, then just change to that dir
and type: ./newcastle_mac

*** The Mac 32Bit version is deprecated! I am not accepting bug reports for this version, it's now old, outdated, defunct.

Note: For PC Dos/Windows there are several versions available - use the one that suits your preference...
there is an EXE installer (with built-in uninstaller) - and also this version as a ZIP file and as a RAR - pick the one you like
then there are two "plain" versions - as RAR or as ZIP - again pick your preference.
The plain versions uncompress and create a "newcastle" directory with everything in it but have no desktop shortcut or uninstaller.

Raspberry Pi (Arm) version of Castle completed and is now available!

See the castle_user_guide.pdf for more information on the game
