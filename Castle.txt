    It is said that there is an Old Castle nearby where long lost treasures
lay in wait of a Brave Knight to uncover them and find his fortune.

That is all there is as far as instructions go, the help file follows thusly:

==============================================================================
When you type in a move, I only look at the first five letters of the first
two words.  To move to another location, type the first letter of the
direction (eg: N-North) or the whole word if you wish.

I have a fairly broad (no pun intended) vocabulary, so if you get into
trouble, just keep trying different words.  The first word should be a verb
and the second an object or noun.

'HELP' will print this out again,
'SCORE' will print your score, and
'QUIT' will end the game.
==============================================================================

There is very little advice I can offer, you mostly have to figure out the
mystery yourself.  The best advice I can give is to keep your commands as
simple as possible.  The parser has been mostly confined to cover those things
that directly involve the game, if a command does not fit (even loosely) the
game will give you a message along the lines of "I don't understand that".
The only other piece of advice I can think of is to tell you not to bother
even attempting to map the maze.  Yes, there is a maze within the game, but it
has been constructed randomly, not only is each game different (the maze is
not constructed at the beginning of each play, but is however dynamically made
AS YOU PLAY, move for move.  Not to worry, there is a solution, which remains
fixed every game, it was calculated randomly as well, but at least it stays
fixed and is the same every play.  There are also two other methods of getting
out of the maze.  Since there is a fixed path, during your travels randomly
moving throughout the maze, it is possible to "get back on track", that is,
you can still exit via the fixed route from the current route onward if the
room you are in is part of the exit path.  This also allows for the psuedo-
random exit path which can also be used to exit.

What is the purpose, or goal of the game?  Why, to find all the treasures of
course!  The maximum score is 590, at the moment, you are not penalized very
much for excess moves (I don't want to make it too hard, especially if you
get lost in the maze), so the goal is to enjoy yourself, mapping the castle is
a good idea, find all the treasure, and figure out the big mystery, coming as
close to 590 as possible.

There are a few added commands which may come in handy, they are:

BRIEF   - Puts the game in brief mode (no room descriptions, etc)
VERBOSE - Puts the game in verbose mode (rooms always described, etc)
MODE    - Will switch between brief/verbose modes
HINT    - Gives you a hint (somewhat checks solvability, etc) - DRAW A MAP!!!
SAVE    - Save current game for later restore (handy!)
LOAD/RESTORE - Restores a saved game (save game files are about 2K in size)
          save and restore cannot be accessed within the maze, also cannot
          be accessed during the end-game, also not during certain other
          special encounters
RESTART - Will restart the game from scratch. Alternately you can use the
          LOAD/RESTORE position #6, but subject to conditions above
TOP TEN - Displays the top ten players list (win and get your name on it)
L/LOOK/EXAM/EXAMINE-Display verbose room contents when used alone
LOOK    - Works the same as examine (see below) when used as a complete command
EXAMINE - I've added the ability to examine (exam) objects within the game.
          Note that this applies ONLY to items, not treasures, and you must be
          carrying the item to examine it.  There are also four stationary
          objects within the game that you can examine (one is the snake pit,
          another object you can Look at is the tree).

I've also found a few people (my playtesters) had problems finding The Castle
or getting to it in the first place.  So if you get stuck trying to figure out
how to get in, and everything seems hopeless, enter and leave the shack a few
times, after you've visited it about 20 times, there is a 80% chance the
game will give you a very useful hint...

More hints: Don't even THINK about trying to map the maze. I think I said this
already... :)  Also, the game as of v3.0 added a new "probability generator"
which is 100% accurate, and used for many (many) parts of the game now...

I've added a new "fun" command "/say" to the command line, which will allow you
to go through the various sayings (over 5,400 currently) without playing.

In an effort to make the game more "fun", multitudes of things have been added.
On top of "easter eggs" galore, miscellaneous messages and various referrences
have been added to the game. Everything from...

The New Castle v4.0 (developmental) was created on an IBM Compatible 486DX50Mhz
using Turbo Pascal v7.01, somewhat translated from the Fortran/IV/F77 Version,
we had none of the original source code to convert, this entire game was done
from memory (some of us are blessed with photographic memories), as well as
transcripts of past games (somewhat).  The New Castle requires about 2.0MB of
disk space (plus space for save games), and a standard IBM Compatible using
MS Dos v3.3 or higher, monochrome or higher graphics, and a minimum 300k Ram.
A far cry from most new games requiring pentium-IVs or Vs and gigs of space..

Send me any ideas, suggestions or problems (with suggestive solutions) to me
at my address below.  For those wanna-be or die-hard hackers out there, yes,
I've left the 'debugging' modes intact in the game, you just have to find it.
I am always looking for comments or constructive criticism, and leaving the
special mode in should help decrease any future bugs (there are no known
bugs within the current version, but then this hasn't been circulated much).

One final note: the game does self-crc checking to prevent virus contamination
or other corruption.  If the game detects a change within itself, it will not
execute, this is to safe-guard your system.  If this happens, just re-install
the game from the original (safegaurded) backup.

As of Castle v4.0 it is *FULLY* Y2K Compliant! (whoo!) :)
(In case you missed the joke here, there is NO date-checking code!)

Castle was first written by: Barry Wilks on a VAX/VMS Computer System at the
University of Western Ontario, back some time around 1978.  According to the
information I have available, the original program was written in VMS Fortran
but the project was never completed.  I have taken great pains to see that
this program was duplicated in every detail, including the kludges.  I have
completed the original adventure game, in the only manner that seemed possible
and spent several months trying all possible combinations.  This is one reason
I believe the project was left incomplete, as there were a lot of unexplained
parts, be that as it may, it is represented here for your enjoyment.
